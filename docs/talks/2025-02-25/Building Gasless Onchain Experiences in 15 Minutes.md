# Building Gasless Onchain Experiences in 15 Minutes | Tina He & Nick Prince - Base

## 1. Main Points
- **Introduction**: The video aims to demonstrate how to build gasless onchain experiences in less than 10 minutes.
- **Problem Addressed**: Gas fees are a significant friction point for onchain users, hindering adoption and retention.
- **Solution**: Using Paymaster technology, which allows users to sponsor transactions, simplifying the user experience.
- **Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP)**: Offers a paymaster solution with no upfront fees and detailed logs for real-time analytics.
- **Onchain Kit**: A toolkit that simplifies building onchain apps by providing pre-made components for faster and easier development.
- **Integration Examples**: Demonstrations of integrating with tools like Uniswap and Moro vaults for earning yield.
- **b.org Builders**: A new site consolidating all the tools created by Base for easier discovery and getting started with onchain building.

## 2. Key Insights
- **Gasless Experience**: Gasless transactions remove the need for users to fund their wallets with ETH, making onchain interactions more accessible and user-friendly.
- **Paymaster Technology**: This technology allows developers to sponsor user transactions, abstracting away the complexity of gas fees.
- **Onchain Kit**: This toolkit provides a full-stack solution, enabling developers to build onchain apps without needing extensive blockchain knowledge.
- **Integration with AI Tools**: Onchain Kit is AI-friendly, allowing for serverless deployment and integration with AI tools like Cursor and Replicate.
- **Reduced Development Time**: The toolkit has reduced the time to build an app from 10 minutes to under 3 minutes in some cases.
- **Community Feedback**: The toolkit has received positive feedback from the community, including non-developers who have successfully built apps.

## 3. Practical Takeaways
- **Use Paymaster for Gasless Transactions**: Implement Paymaster technology to sponsor user transactions and remove the friction of gas fees.
- **Leverage Onchain Kit**: Utilize the Onchain Kit to build onchain apps faster and more easily, with components for swaps, transactions, and more.
- **Explore b.org Builders**: Visit the b.org Builders site to discover and get started with the tools provided by Base for onchain development.
- **Provide Feedback**: Share feedback on the tools and technologies used to help improve and refine them for better developer experiences.

## 4. Additional Notes
- The video emphasizes the importance of simplifying the onchain experience for users, particularly by removing the need to manage gas fees.
- The Onchain Kit is highlighted as a powerful tool for developers, enabling them to build complex onchain apps with minimal blockchain knowledge.
- The community aspect is also stressed, with examples of non-developers successfully building onchain apps using the provided tools.
