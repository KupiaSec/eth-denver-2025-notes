# Staying Safe in Web3 | Taylor Monahan - Metamask | Griff Green - Giveth |

This video is a fireside chat discussing web3 wallet safety, hosted by Griff Green (founder of Giveth) and Taylor Monahan (security at Metamask).

**1. Main Points**

* **Focus on user security:** The discussion highlights the importance of user security, both for general web3 users and high-profile individuals or teams.
* **Risks of centralized exchanges:** The conversation emphasizes the risks associated with using centralized exchanges, noting their susceptibility to hacks.

* **Importance of community involvement:** The potential of ongoing community involvement in fostering a safer web3 environment is raised.
* **Protection against phishing attacks:**  The importance of being wary of phishing links and scams is underlined.

**2. Key Insights**

* **Decentralized Security:** The conversation clearly differentiates centralized exchanges from decentralized wallet-based systems, advocating for secure wallets and community-driven alternatives as providing a layer of security against centralized exchange exploits and hacks.
* **The Human Factor:** The discussion emphasizes the human element, particularly scams, phishing attacks, and general user education as essential factors in assessing real-world web3 safety. Griff and Taylor highlight the ongoing nature of security in Web3 and the need for continuous user training regarding scams to mitigate risk.
