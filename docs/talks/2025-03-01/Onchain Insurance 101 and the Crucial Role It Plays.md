## Onchain Insurance 101 and Its Crucial Role | Jeremiah Smith - OpenCover

### 1. Main Points
- **Introduction to Onchain Insurance**: Jeremiah Smith introduces the concept of onchain insurance, explaining its role in protecting users against various risks in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.
- **Types of Onchain Risks**: He categorizes onchain risks into custody risk, transaction risk, protocol risk, and asset risk, detailing how each can be mitigated through insurance.
- **Protocols and Tools**: Smith discusses various protocols and tools like transaction cover, protocol insurance, and asset cover, explaining their mechanisms and benefits.
- **Cost and Availability**: He provides insights into the cost of onchain insurance, which can range from 0.15% to 5% of the value covered for a year, depending on the protocol and underwriter.
- **Community Engagement**: Smith invites viewers to join a Telegram group for further learning and discussion on DeFi and risk management.

### 2. Key Insights
- **Risk Transfer Mechanisms**: Onchain insurance acts as a safety net, transferring risks away from users and protocols. It is particularly important for new protocols to build trust and attract users.
- **Transaction Safety**: Tools like transaction cover can help prevent malicious transactions by scanning and validating them before they are executed, offering a proactive way to keep users safe.
- **Protocol Insurance**: This type of insurance protects against losses due to protocol hacks or failures. It is crucial for builders to offer this to their users to build a safety track record.
- **Asset Cover**: This covers assets against price fluctuations, providing protection against de-pegging events like the Terra USD collapse.
- **Cost Considerations**: The cost of onchain insurance varies based on the asset, protocol, and underwriter, but it is generally a small percentage of the value covered, making it a worthwhile investment for risk mitigation.

### 3. Practical Takeaways
- **Understand Risk Categories**: Identify and understand the different types of risks (custody, transaction, protocol, asset) associated with onchain activities.
- **Utilize Available Tools**: Leverage tools like transaction cover, protocol insurance, and asset cover to mitigate these risks effectively.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Evaluate the cost of onchain insurance against the potential losses and decide on the appropriate coverage based on your risk tolerance.
- **Community Learning**: Join relevant communities and groups for continuous learning and staying updated on the latest developments in onchain insurance and DeFi.

### 4. Additional Notes
- **Regulatory Considerations**: Onchain insurance is not regulated like traditional insurance, but it serves a similar purpose in providing a safety net for users.
- **Importance of Education**: Education plays a crucial role in helping users understand the importance of onchain insurance and how to use it effectively.
- **Future Developments**: As the DeFi ecosystem evolves, onchain insurance is expected to become more sophisticated and widely adopted, offering more comprehensive protection against various risks.
