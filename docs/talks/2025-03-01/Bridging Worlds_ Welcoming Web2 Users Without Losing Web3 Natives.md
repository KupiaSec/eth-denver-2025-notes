Here's a summary of the YouTube video "Bridging Worlds: Welcoming Web2 Users Without Losing Web3 Natives", based on the provided transcript:

**1. Main Points:**

*   **Bridging the Gap:** The core challenge is designing Web3 products that are accessible and understandable for Web2 users (normies) without alienating or limiting the capabilities for experienced Web3 users (degens/power users).
*   **User Research is Key:** The fundamentals of user research remain the same between Web2 and Web3.  Understanding user needs, desires, and behaviors is crucial, regardless of the technology.
*   **Web3's Unique Challenges:**  Finding the *right* users for research is harder in Web3 due to privacy concerns and a less established user base. However, Web3 offers unique advantages like on-chain data for user verification.
*   **The "Barbell Strategy":**  A recommended approach is to create a "barbell" design – one end is highly accessible and simple for new users, while the other end provides full transparency and control for power users.  Avoid getting "stuck in the middle."
*   **Progressive Disclosure:**  Gradually introduce complexity to new users as they become more comfortable with basic Web3 concepts.  Don't overwhelm them upfront.
*   **Language Matters:**  Web3 has its own jargon and culture, which can be a barrier to entry.  Using common language and bridging the terminology gap is crucial for onboarding Web2 users.
*   **Focus on the "Job to Be Done":**  Understand what problem the user is trying to solve, and focus the design on helping them accomplish that goal efficiently.
*    **Web3 is Inherently Social:** tap into pre-exisiting social spaces like telegram/discord, user recommendations/referrals are currently the lowest friction way for new users to get started.

**2. Key Insights:**

*   **Web3 User Research Differences:** While the *methods* of user research are similar (interviews, surveys, etc.), the *context* differs.  Web3 users are often more privacy-conscious and may be involved in building the products they use, creating a "builder mentality."
*   **The Double-Edged Sword of On-Chain Data:**  On-chain data provides objective truth about user behavior, but privacy must be respected.  It helps validate research participants but also creates a barrier.
*    **Complexity as a Feature (and a Bug):**  The complexity of Web3 *can* be a feature, enabling opportunities for arbitrage and financial gain. However, for mass adoption, this complexity needs to be managed.  This leads to the feature vs bug debate.
*   **"Midwit" Trap:**  Avoid designs that are too complex for beginners but too simplistic for power users.  This "middle ground" satisfies no one.
*   **Web2 Benchmarks Still Apply:** Users have expectations of usability based on their Web2 experiences. Web3 products should strive to meet or exceed these benchmarks where possible.  Users know "good design" when they see it, even if they can't articulate *why*.
*   **The User Journey:**  Understanding how users are introduced to Web3 (often through friends) and their gradual exposure to different aspects of the technology ("meme coins" to more complex DeFi, for example) is critical for effective onboarding.
*   **Signal vs. Noise:** In Web3, there's a lot of noise (hype, jargon, rapid changes).  Good UX research helps filter the noise and identify the true user signal.
* **Attitudinal vs. Behavioral Research:** The first (attitudinal) determines what people think, are feeling, it helps identify the *why*, the second (behavioral) tracks what they do, to determine *what* is happening.

**3. Practical Takeaways:**

*   **Conduct Frequent User Research:**  Talk to users as often as possible, especially during early development.  Put designs (even wireframes) in front of users early and often.
*   **Implement Progressive Disclosure:** Design your product to reveal complexity gradually.  Start with a simple, core experience, and then allow users to "unlock" more advanced features as they become comfortable.
*   **Use the Barbell Strategy:** Design two distinct experiences within the same product – a highly accessible entry point and a powerful, transparent option for experienced users.
*   **Leverage Existing Communities:** Utilize Telegram, Discord, and Twitter to engage with potential and existing users.  These are natural habitats for Web3 users.
*   **Focus on the "Job to Be Done":** Frame your research questions around what task the user is trying to accomplish.  "What job is this customer hiring our product to do?"
*   **Observe User Behavior:**  Don't just rely on what users *say*; watch what they *do*.  Usability testing is crucial.
*   **Recruit the Right Participants:** Leverage tools (like those mentioned, such as Despark) to find and verify genuine Web3 users for your research. Use on-chain data ethically.
*   **Benchmark Against Web2:**  Don't reinvent the wheel.  Look at successful Web2 products for inspiration on usability and user experience.
*   **Prioritize ruthlessly:** An hour spent talking to customer could save five to ten dev hours.
*   **Speak their language":** Bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 terminology.
* **"Playbook":** Start putting together a playbook with UX best practices for your own team or product.

**4. Additional Notes:**

*   The panelists work for Dune (formerly Dune Analytics), Phantom, and Despark, providing diverse perspectives from the data analytics, wallet, and user testing spaces.
*   The discussion emphasizes a shift from simply *asking* users what they want to *observing* what they do and understanding their underlying needs.
* The conversation touches upon a community led user-centric design mafia.

This summary captures the essence of the "Bridging Worlds" discussion, providing a comprehensive overview for anyone interested in designing user-friendly Web3 products.
