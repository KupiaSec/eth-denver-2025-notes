Here's a summary of the YouTube video "Building Community First Protocols The Movement Story From Will Gaines Movement Labs," formatted as requested:

**1. Main Points:**

*   **Community-First Approach:** Will Gaines emphasizes building a strong, engaged community *before* focusing on product development or fundraising. Movement Labs prioritizes organic growth and genuine engagement.
*   **The Power of Decentralization:** Gaines's journey highlights his belief in decentralization as a way to empower creators and users, removing predatory middlemen (like record labels).
*    **Movement Labs' Origin:**  Movement Labs was started by two college dropouts, Cooper Scanlon and Rushi, whose vision aligned with Gaines. They grew a massive community rapidly (hundreds of thousands of users across different platforms) in less than a year since launching from stealth.
*   **The "Guild" System:** Movement Labs uses a guild system inspired by MMOs (Massively Multiplayer Online games, specifically *World of Warcraft* in GAines Case), where community members can participate in different roles (creators, builders, teachers, etc.) and be recognized/rewarded.
*   **Inclusivity and Belonging:** Gaines stresses the importance of creating an inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome and represented, regardless of their background or role within the Web3 space.  He explicitly rejects the "us vs. them" mentality common in some crypto communities.
*   **Authenticity and Transparency:**  A major factor in Movement Labs' rapid growth was their authenticity and genuine belief in their mission, as opposed to focusing on hype or "grift".
*   **The Importance of Moderators:** Gaines strongly advocates for recognizing and integrating community moderators into the marketing team, as they are the front line of communication with the user base.
*    **Move Programming Langauge:** Movement Lab is bringing the Move programming language to the Ethereum ecosystem.
* **Mainnet Launch:** Movement Labs' mainnet is planned for March (presumably March 2025, based on context).

**2. Key Insights:**

*   **Web3 as an Escape and a Tool:** Gaines's personal story of using *World of Warcraft* as an escape from real-world prejudice is a powerful analogy for the potential of Web3 communities. It highlights the desire for belonging and the power of virtual economies.
*   **Gamification of Community Building:** The deliberate use of MMO mechanics (guilds, roles, rewards) demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of how to incentivize participation and create a sense of ownership within the community.  It's not just about building a user base; it's about building a *world*.
*   **The Shift from "Community as an Afterthought" to "Community as the Foundation":**  Gaines implicitly critiques the traditional startup model where community building is often a secondary concern after product development and funding.  He argues that a strong, engaged community is a *prerequisite* for success in Web3. This contrasts sharply with many projects that prioritize tokenomics and hype over genuine user engagement.
*   **The Value Exchange in Web3:** Gaines emphasizes that community members are often contributing their time and effort for free.  Therefore, projects have a responsibility to provide value (opportunities, recognition, rewards) in return.  This reinforces the idea that Web3 communities are *not* just collections of users, but active participants in a shared ecosystem.
* **Exclusivity vs. Inclusivity:** The speaker criticizes the gatekeeping and exclusionary tendencies within the Web3 space. He advocates for a welcoming environment that attracts diverse participation, emphasizing that collaboration across different blockchain ecosystems is more productive than competition.
* **Rejection of Short-Term Hype:** Gaines' focus on genuine community building and long-term value creation serves as a critique of the "get-rich-quick" mentality that pervades parts of the crypto world. He explicitly mentions being tired of the "grift" and "vaporware."
* **The leader provides value to the Community:** The presentation concludes with an extended consideration that it should be the case that projects build 'for' the community, and the community builds 'with' the project.

**3. Practical Takeaways:**

*   **Prioritize Community Building:** If launching a Web3 protocol or project, focus on building a genuine community from the start.  Don't treat it as an afterthought.
*   **Identify and Empower Community Leaders:** Recognize and integrate active community members (especially moderators) into your team.  Give them roles and responsibilities, and leverage their insights.
*   **Create Opportunities for Participation:** Design systems (like guilds) that allow users to contribute in different ways and be recognized for their efforts.  Gamification can be a powerful tool.
*   **Be Authentic and Transparent:** Communicate your mission clearly and genuinely.  Avoid hype and focus on building real value.
*   **Foster Inclusivity:**  Make your community a welcoming space for people of all backgrounds and levels of experience.
*   **Think Long-Term:**  Focus on building a sustainable community that provides lasting value, rather than chasing short-term gains.
*   **Value Your Community's Time:** Acknowledge and reward the contributions of your community members. Treat them as partners, not just users.
*   **Consider the "Guild" Model:** Explore the concept of structuring your community around different roles and activities, inspired by MMOs.
* **Web3 marketing through community:** Don't do marketing 'at' your community, but utilize the members of the community that are already doing the things you'd want to do in marketing.
