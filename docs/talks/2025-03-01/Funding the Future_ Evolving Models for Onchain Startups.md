Here's a summary of the YouTube video "Funding the Future: Evolving Models for Onchain Startups | Jonathan King | Debra Nita |" based on the provided transcript:

**1. Main Points:**

*   **Democratization of Early-Stage Investing:** New platforms like Echo (built on Base) are opening up traditionally private, VC-dominated seed rounds to a broader audience, including retail investors.
*   **Rise of Onchain Capital Formation:** The discussion highlights a shift towards onchain fundraising models, moving away from the traditional ICO model, now considered "outdated."
*   **Hybrid Funding Models:** Startups are increasingly adopting a blended approach, combining traditional VC funding with community-based fundraising (e.g., through platforms like Echo or token launchpads).
* **Alignment of Incentives**: Onchain models give skin in the game to retail investors.
*   **VCs Still Relevant:** Traditional VCs still play a crucial role, offering value-adds like network access, policy expertise, and strategic guidance.
*  **Founders value Community** Some founders are forgoing VC funding altogether and prefer to only have community backers.
*   **Evolution of Crypto VC:**  The history of crypto VC is discussed, from the early days of generalist funds investing in Bitcoin-related companies (2013-2016), through the ICO boom and bust (2016-2018), to the institutionalization of crypto VC (2018 onwards).
*  **Coinbase Ventures Strategy** Coinbase Ventures will continue to be long-term aligned with founders.
*   **Predictions for the Future:** A convergence of traditional institutional capital with retail participation in onchain fundraising is expected.
*  **Key Areas of Focus**: Crypto AI, Stablecoins/Payments, and Defi that opens it up to retail.

**2. Key Insights:**

*   **Retail Investor Demand:** The rapid fundraising success of Mega Labs on Echo ($10 million in 3 minutes) demonstrated substantial pent-up demand from retail investors for access to early-stage crypto projects.
*   **ICO 2.0 (Onchain Capital Formation):** The speakers agree that while the term "ICO" is outdated, the current trend represents a more mature and regulated form of onchain fundraising. It's less about speculative coin offerings and more about building sustainable projects with aligned incentives.
*   **"Low Float, High FDV" Critique:** Jonathan King addresses the critique of projects launching with a low circulating supply of tokens and a high fully diluted valuation (FDV). This practice, prevalent in 2022-2024, led to volatility as VC-held tokens unlocked, creating sell pressure. The new platforms aim to mitigate this by giving retail investors similar terms and lockup periods as VCs.
*   **Value Add of VCs:** VCs aren't just about capital. They bring a network of connections (other portfolio companies, policy experts, etc.) and strategic advice that individual retail investors typically cannot provide. This is why many founders still seek VC funding, even with alternative options available.
*   **Complementary, Not Competitive:** The new onchain platforms are presented as complementary to traditional VC, not necessarily as a direct replacement.  They offer founders more options and allow for a hybrid approach.
*   **Importance of Transparency and Alignment:** The onchain nature of these new platforms promotes transparency. Investors (both retail and institutional) can see the terms, lockup periods, and other details on the blockchain. This fosters greater trust and aligns incentives between founders and the community.
*  **Founders still value VCs**: Founders usually pick VC funding for the Value-Add that they can bring, compared to just community-backed funding.

**3. Practical Takeaways:**

*   **For Founders:**
    *   Consider a hybrid fundraising model, leveraging both traditional VC relationships and the power of community engagement through onchain platforms.
    *   Carefully evaluate the value-adds offered by potential VCs (network, expertise, etc.) beyond just capital.
    *    Be transparent with your community about fundraising terms and tokenomics.
    *   Recognize the increased options available for capital formation and choose the path that best aligns with your project's goals and values.
    *  Think about what's valuable to the founder and where they are in the founder journey, and what avenue of funding is suitable.
*   **For Investors (Retail & Institutional):**
    *   Explore new onchain platforms for accessing early-stage investment opportunities that were previously unavailable.
    *   Due diligence is still crucial. Understand the project's fundamentals, team, tokenomics, and lockup periods, regardless of the fundraising method.
    *   Institutional investors should adapt to the evolving landscape and consider how to integrate onchain strategies into their investment approach.
*    **For Everyone:**
     * Understand the history and evolution of crypto fundraising to better contextualize the current trends.
     *  Stay informed about new platforms and models emerging in the onchain capital formation space.
