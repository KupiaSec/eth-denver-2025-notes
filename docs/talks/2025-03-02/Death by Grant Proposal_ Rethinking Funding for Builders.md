# Death by Grant Proposal: Rethinking Funding for Builders

This Encode Club video with Eomji Park discusses the challenges and potential flaws in current grant proposal processes for builders in the Web3 space, and offers alternative approaches.

## 1. Main Points

* **Current grant mechanisms are often flawed:** They prioritize attracting builders for quick returns, rather than long-term commitment to the ecosystem.
* **Grant proposals are too transactional:** They focus on superficial metrics, overlooking the meaningful impact a builder can generate.
* **Lack of community-driven funding:** The current system often overlooks the needs and desires of the community.
* **Misaligned incentives:** The structure often incentivizes short-term gains at the expense of long-term ecosystem growth.
* **Need for proactive, long-term funding:** Rethinking incentives and support mechanisms to attract builders committed to the long-term health of Web3.


## 2. Key Insights

* **The focus on attracting "grand chasers" harms the long-term growth:** The current model emphasizes quick returns for funding, leading to a lack of experienced and invested builders.
* **Incentivizing short-term gains over long-term impact leads to a lack of retention:** Successful protocols often need active builders for sustained development, which is stifled by the frequent and transactional approach.  Park highlights a need for the funding mechanism to not only attract talented builders but to also retain them.
* **Retroactive funding has drawbacks:**  Park emphasizes that incentives should be in place early in the process to encourage ongoing participation. Retrospective funding models are prone to attracting individuals driven only by financial gain.
* **Importance of the community:** Community-driven funding mechanisms or those designed  with the community in mind can lead to a more sustainable and vibrant Web3 ecosystem. The community plays a critical role in project success, validation, and long-term growth.
* **Funding models must align with the business goals:**  Current approaches often misalign with project goals, creating a disconnect between the protocol's needs and the incentives builders are pursuing.


## 3. Practical Takeaways

* **Design funding mechanisms with long-term commitment in mind:**  Encourage long-term participation and sustainable growth of the Web3 ecosystem.
* **Prioritize community-driven funding:**  Take into account the community's needs and feedback.
* **Aligning incentives with project goals:** Build funding models that reward meaningful contribution and sustained participation.
* **Promote proactive funding structures:**  Avoid solely relying on retroactive grants.
* **Develop robust tracking and evaluation systems:**  Create methods to ensure accountability and assess the actual impact of funding.
* **Consider different funding models:**  Experiment with diverse and appropriate funding approaches based on the stage and needs of the project.  Consider a hybrid approach to funding. 
* **Look for and reward value-adding contributions:** Support the retention of builders who make significant contributions to the Web3 ecosystem.


## 4. Additional Notes

The video emphasizes the need for a more nuanced and strategic approach to funding in the Web3 space, moving away from a purely transactional model.  It suggests the need for flexibility in the funding mechanism to accommodate different project stages and team structures.  A focus on attracting and retaining talent for long-term impact, rather than short-term gains, is crucial for a healthy and thriving Web3 ecosystem.
