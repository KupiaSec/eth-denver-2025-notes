# Audits Are Not Enough | Odysseus Lamtzidis - phylax systems

This YouTube video argues that audits alone are insufficient for ensuring the security of blockchain systems, particularly in the context of the quickly evolving crypto landscape.

## 1. Main Points

* **Audits are insufficient:**  Audits, while valuable, are static snapshots and don't account for dynamic security threats. They're not enough to catch all vulnerabilities.
* **Self-regulation and best practices:**  The speaker emphasizes the importance of self-regulation and the adoption of best practices within the blockchain industry to address its unique security challenges.
* **Focus on the base layer:**  The video highlights the need to focus on security at the base layer of blockchain systems, not just as an afterthought in the form of audits.
* **Ongoing security:**  Continuous monitoring and improvement are critical, rather than infrequent audits.  Security needs to be integral to the development process.
* **Risk-adjusted yields:**  The crypto market often prioritizes high yields over other considerations like security.  As a result, institutions can be drawn into taking risks.
* **Crypto's inherent risks:** The presenter emphasizes that crypto is inherently risky, and entities taking part in it need to be able to manage risks.
* **Institutions and everyday users:**  The video distinguishes between institutional and everyday users in crypto, noting that both groups have varying approaches to risk and security. The video argues that one-size-fits-all auditing isn't suited for the different approaches to security management.
* **Formal verification and code integrity:**  Formal security verification of blockchain code is crucial.  This involves examining code for vulnerabilities, potential attacks, and ensuring code integrity and mutability.


## 2. Key Insights

* **Static vs. Dynamic Security:** A key insight is the distinction between static security assessments (like audits) and the ongoing, dynamic nature of security threats in the blockchain ecosystem.  Audits, while important, provide only a snapshot in time and don't predict or address evolving vulnerabilities.
* **Incentivizing Base Layer Security:**  Critically, the video also suggests that security needs to be incentivized intrinsically within the design of the blockchain's base layer in order to maintain long-term security. This contrasts with an external audit approach that is often reactive.

## 3. Practical Takeaways

* **Integrate security throughout the development lifecycle:** Move beyond infrequent audits and build a layered security approach into the initial design and testing phases.
* **Develop a dynamic security strategy:**  Recognize that security is not static and must adapt to continuously evolving threats, vulnerabilities, and risks. 
* **Embrace self-regulation:** Encourage the adoption of internal security protocols and best practices by blockchain system developers.
* **Invest in continuous security monitoring:** Implement continuous monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to incidents promptly. This should include ongoing code testing and reviews.
* **Assess risk tolerance:** Understand and manage risk tolerance across different actors in the blockchain ecosystem, recognizing different levels of risk appetite.


## 4. Additional Notes

The speaker, Odysseus Lamtzidis, clearly has deep expertise and experience in blockchain security and systems. He emphasizes that, in the current paradigm, having a layered, intrinsic, and adaptive approach to cybersecurity is critical to ongoing security.  The presentation also suggests that the evolving DeFi landscape requires nuanced approaches beyond traditional security auditing.
