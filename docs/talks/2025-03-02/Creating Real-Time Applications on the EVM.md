# Creating Real-Time Applications on the EVM | Paul Thomas - Somnia

This YouTube video, presented by Paul Thomas of Somnia, discusses the creation of real-time applications on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

## 1. Main Points

* **Somnia's approach to real-time applications on the EVM.**
* **Performance characteristics of Somnia's technology.**
* **High throughput and low latency achieved.**
* **Sub-second latency for millions of transactions per second.**
* **Scalability of Somnia for various industries.**
* **Interoperability between digital assets.**
* **Focus on low costs (gas fees).**
* **Reactive blockchain for onchain data updates.**
* **No modifications or forks of base systems.**
* **Powerful on-the-fly EVM compilation.**
* **Efficient and specialized database (ICB).**
* **New consensus mechanism (multistream consensus).**
* **Improved compression ratios and networking efficiency.**


## 2. Key Insights

Paul Thomas's presentation highlights that building real-time applications on the EVM presents significant challenges, particularly in terms of scalability and cost.  Somnia's approach is designed to address these challenges by utilizing several key techniques:

* **Specialized, highly optimized database (ICB) for handling blockchain data.** This specialized database gives Somnia superior performance, particularly in frequent read and write operations.
* **New consensus mechanisms (Multistream consensus) effectively increase throughput. The presentation stresses this isn't a fork or modification.** Somnia's system is designed to work harmoniously with the existing Ethereum ecosystem, highlighting the fundamental point of not modifying the EVM baseline to achieve high performance.
* **Novel data compression methodologies.** This is critical to reducing data size on the chain, reducing transaction costs.
* **On-the-fly EVM compilationâ€”the ability to compile EVM bytecode into machine code on the fly**, is a core competence of Somnia. This allows for a seamless transition between EVM codes and standard machine architectures.
* **The core value proposition is focused on the underlying high throughput and low latency transaction speeds.** This allows for broader use of Ethereum in real-time applications without the cost and complexity of Layer-2 solutions.


## 3. Practical Takeaways

* **Evaluation of Somnia's claims regarding performance.** Developers should critically evaluate Somnia's claims of transaction throughput and latency.
* **Investigate Somnia's whitepaper for technical details.**  Full understanding of the technical underpinnings of Somnia is required for serious consideration.
* **Explore the implications of Somnia's architecture on Ethereum ecosystems.** For example, look at how interoperability is facilitated.
* **Consider how to incorporate Somnia into existing or new decentralized applications.** If Somnia can provide needed performance, there could be opportunities to develop real-time applications within the Ethereum ecosystem. This could be done using a combination of existing smart contracts.
* **Assess Somnia's impact on various application fields.** Explore how Somnia's potential speeds can be applied across a wide range of industries.

## 4. Additional Notes

The video is well presented and appears to be a compelling overview of a real-time EVM solution.  However, further research into Somnia's implementation and benchmarks is needed for validation before it is integrated into critical systems.  The speaker emphasizes the importance of not modifying the core EVM, opting instead for specialized optimizations that enhance the operation of existing EVM codes without altering them.  This is a crucial aspect of their value proposition to the Ethereum community.
