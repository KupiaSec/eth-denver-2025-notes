# Video Summary: "Unf**king Incentives: Better Retention With Grants and Rewards"

This video, presented by Vijay Michalik of Superfluid, discusses the often-flawed incentive structures in the cryptocurrency space, particularly regarding airdrops and token rewards, and offers strategies for improving retention.


## 1. Main Points

* **Incentive structures in crypto are often flawed.**  Airdrops and rewards are often poorly designed, leading to low retention rates.
* **Short-term gains vs. long-term value.**  The focus on quick gains from airdrops often overlooks the long-term health of the project and user engagement.
* **Lack of transparency and clear value proposition.**  Many airdrop programs lack a clear value proposition, leading users to perceive them as "getting something for nothing."
* **Poor user experience.**  Incentives are frequently disconnected from user onboarding, product usage, and community interaction.
* **Overemphasis on vanity metrics.**  Projects often focus on vanity metrics like follower counts or wallet addresses instead of meaningful user behavior and engagement.
* **Programmatic incentives are usually more effective.**  A well-designed reward system based on user behavior and value contribution is crucial for long-term retention.
* **The need for honest, long-term value propositions.**  Transparency and a concrete vision for the project are key to attracting and retaining true stakeholders.
* **Avoidance of misleading metrics.**   Projects shouldn't focus on inflating meaningless metrics to seem successful.
* **Importance of clear and long-term plans.**  Projects need a clear roadmap and long-term strategy for their success rather than chasing short-term gains with airdrops or other incentives.
* **Building a sustainable user base.** The focus should be on creating community and retaining users by fostering genuine engagement that provides value to the ecosystem.


## 2. Key Insights

* **The speaker argues that many projects are incentivizing the wrong behaviors.**  Airdrops can attract a large number of users initially, but these users often aren't invested in the long-term success of the project, which results in low engagement levels. The video suggests that focusing on attracting the right kind of user, those deeply invested in the project's long-term vision, is crucial for sustainable growth.
* **Projects often fail to consider the impact of their rewards on the entire ecosystem.**  The speaker emphasizes that "buying up" user bases with rewards will not create a sustainable and healthy ecosystem, since these new users may not truly engage with the long-term mission. This leads to inflated metrics that ultimately provide little actual value.
* **Critically evaluating past airdrop campaigns is essential**. Analyzing previous airdrop campaigns, not only for their effectiveness in attracting users but also their impact on the broader token economy, can help improve future campaigns. Focusing on user experience and overall community health is part of that process.
* **Prioritization of sustainable growth over short-term gains.** The speaker suggests that a focus on real-world metrics (like true user engagement, product usage, and community interaction, rather than vanity metrics like follower counts) will lead to a much more substantial and sustainable growth for the project itself.

## 3. Practical Takeaways

* **Develop a clear, transparent value proposition for your project.**  What problem does your project solve? What long-term benefits does it offer?
* **Design a user-centric reward system that incentivizes meaningful engagement.** Focus on behaviors that contribute value to the project and ecosystem (like governance participation, project feedback, and providing feedback)
* **Avoid inflating vanity metrics.** Focus on building a loyal, engaged community, and real users instead of a fleeting mass who will eventually leave if they don't see long-term value.
* **Continuously evaluate and adapt your incentive programs based on data and user feedback.** Are the people you attract truly stakeholders, or are they just "free riders"?
* **Prioritize long-term sustainability over short-term gains.** A projectâ€™s success needs to be judged over several months or years, not just based on the number of people who join on "day one" with a small airdrop incentive.


## 4. Additional Notes

* The video provides a fairly critical perspective on current cryptocurrency airdrop practices.
* The speaker's suggestions are geared towards improving the overall health of cryptocurrency projects and empowering the community.
* The focus on honest metrics and sustainable user acquisition is crucial for long-term success.
