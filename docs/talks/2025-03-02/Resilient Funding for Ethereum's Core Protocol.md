# Resilient Funding for Ethereum's Core Protocol | Peter Vecchiarelli - Protocol Guild

This video, presented by Peter Vecchiarelli, discusses the Protocol Guild's approach to funding Ethereum's core protocol.

## 1. Main Points

* **Protocol Guild as an on-chain funding institution:**  The Protocol Guild acts as an organization for supporting Ethereum's core protocol by providing funding.
* **Focus on individual contributors:**  The Guild's funding model prioritizes and incentivizes individual contributors rather than large teams.
* **On-chain transparency and accountability:** The funding processes and contributions are transparently recorded on the blockchain, ensuring accountability.
* **Vesting mechanisms:**  Contributors' financial incentives (tokens and rewards) are implemented through immutable vesting contracts, creating long-term stability for projects and contributors.
* **Standardization of funding:** The Guild aims to establish a standard and trusted mechanism for funding, reducing risk for contributors.
* **Emphasis on sustaining core protocol work:**  The work focuses on maintaining the long-term sustainability of the Ethereum core protocol by incentivizing continuous contribution.


## 2. Key Insights

* **Addressing the funding gap problem:** The video highlights a recurring concern that Ethereum's core protocol development hasn't always received commensurate funding compared to its value and importance. The Protocol Guild is designed to address this funding scarcity.
* **Shifting from large team funding to individual contributions:** The presentation suggests that relying on numerous smaller contributions can ensure funding resilience and adaptability over time, contrasted with traditional grant models relying on large team projects. The Protocol Guild structure focuses on the strength and continuity of its individual contributors.
* **Importance of a neutral/legitimate funding mechanism:** The video emphasizes that a fair and transparent framework is crucial for attracting and retaining core protocol developers and contributors, building trust over time. The on-chain transparency allows all participants to see the funding history and track contributors’ commitment.
* **Long-term commitment to Ethereum:** The talk presents the Guild as a long-term commitment to Ethereum, suggesting it's not a short-term solution but a continuously improving framework for sustained contributions.
* **Addressing the ‘Tragedy of the Commons’:** The presentation subtly acknowledges the potential for abuse in a funding structure relying on many small contributors. The vesting mechanisms and the structure of the Protocol Guild seek to mitigate this concern and promote the long-term health of the network.


## 3. Practical Takeaways

* **For Ethereum developers:**  Understand the Protocol Guild's mission, which promotes long-term and secure on-chain funding specifically for Ethereum core protocol work.
* **For investors and potential contributors:**  Explore the Protocol Guild funding model as a potentially more sustainable approach to funding Ethereum's core protocol development than traditional grants.
* **For the Eth ecosystem:** Understand how the Protocol Guild addresses the ongoing need for funding and incentivizing core protocol contributions.  Examine the implications of their approach for the entire ecosystem and potential shifts in project involvement and incentives.
* **Consider the limitations of the current funding model:**  The video raises critical questions about the existing funding practices for core Ethereum protocol development.


## 4. Additional Notes

The video provides concrete examples of prior contributions and shows how the protocol Guild's funding framework is designed to address real-world issues associated with incentivizing core protocol work. The speaker's analysis delves into potential challenges and the need for continued improvement and refinement of the funding infrastructure, illustrating the ongoing work in establishing a stable, accessible, and transparent, on-chain funding mechanism for the benefit of the entire Ethereum ecosystem.
