Okay, here's a comprehensive summary of Jess Houlgrave's "UX: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" presentation, formatted as requested:

**1. Main Points:**

*   **UX is a major barrier to crypto adoption.**  Houlgrave emphasizes that poor user experience is a significant impediment to wider acceptance and use of crypto technologies.
*   **Wallet Connect's role:** Wallet Connect, developed by Reown, aims to address critical UX challenges in web3, particularly connecting mobile wallets to desktop applications.
*   **Wallet Connect's Growth and Decentralization:** Wallet Connect supports a large and growing network of wallets and applications. It has transitioned to a decentralized network managed by the Wallet Connect Foundation.
*   **Focus on Solutions, Not Technology:**  The average user cares more about the benefits (joy, solving problems, making money) than the underlying technology (Web3, blockchain).  Onboarding should focus on these outcomes.
*   **Liquidity fragmentation is a major challenge:** The proliferation of different chains and Layer-2 solutions has created a complex and confusing landscape where assets are siloed.
*   **Seed phrases are still a significant pain point:** Many users have lost funds or access due to issues with managing seed phrases.
*   **Smart sessions (EIP-7715) provide a better UX:** This proposed standard, co-authored by Reown, allows for pre-approved transactions and limited access controls, streamlining the user experience.
*   **Security remains paramount:**  Recent security incidents highlight the ongoing need for better tools and practices to protect users.  Clear signing and transaction simulation are becoming more common.
*   **Too many clicks and constant signing requests are detrimental:**  The need for frequent interaction with wallets disrupts the user flow and hinders adoption.
*  **Focus on UX improvements:** Reown launches a UX counsil, and grant programs.

**2. Key Insights:**

*   **The "power user" vs. "average user" design gap:** Crypto applications are often designed for technically proficient users, creating a barrier for mainstream adoption.  Web3 needs to emulate the seamless experience of Web2, where users don't need to understand the underlying infrastructure.
*   **The evolution of onboarding:** While progress has been made (e.g., social logins, smart accounts), the need to teach users about fundamental Web3 concepts (seed phrases, wallets) remains a significant hurdle.
*   **The analogy to credit cards:**  People use credit cards without understanding the complex payments infrastructure behind them. Crypto needs to achieve the same level of abstraction and ease of use.
*   **Interoperability is crucial, but so is user experience.:**  Technical advancements like interoperability are essential, but they must be implemented in a way that is intuitive and secure for the average user. Smart sessions are a key example of bridging this gap.
*    **Developers must think as everyday users, not crypto users**: Projects need to shift their focus from a technological standpoint to meet the practical needs of everyday users.
*  **Wallets will remain relevant and specialized**. The presenter believes that there's a need for different types of wallets for different cases.

**3. Practical Takeaways:**

*   **Prioritize user-centered design:** Developers should focus on simplifying the user journey and removing unnecessary complexity.  Design for the "average user," not the "power user."
*   **Embrace smart sessions and account abstraction:**  These technologies can significantly improve the user experience by reducing the need for constant signing and providing more granular control.
*   **Integrate clear signing and transaction simulation:**  Provide users with clear, understandable information about the transactions they are authorizing.
*   **Explore solutions for liquidity fragmentation:** Developers and platforms should work towards solutions that allow users to seamlessly manage assets across different chains.
*   **Support initiatives like the Wallet Connect Foundation's UX Council:**  Collaboration within the industry is vital to developing and promoting best practices for UX.
*   **Seek funding for UX improvements:**  Grants and funding programs, like the one offered by the Wallet Connect Foundation, can help drive innovation in UX design.
*   **Reduce the number of clicks and interactions:** Streamline workflows to minimize the cognitive load on users.  Every interaction should be valuable and justified.
*   **Focus on the benefits, not the tech:** When onboarding new users, emphasize the practical advantages of using crypto and Web3 applications, rather than focusing on the technical details.

**4. Additional Notes:**

*   The presentation centers on the experiences and developments within the Wallet Connect ecosystem, but the broader principles apply to the entire Web3 space.
*   The speaker's background in payments and NFTs provides a valuable perspective on bridging the gap between traditional finance and crypto.
*   The call to action is for a collective effort: developers, wallets, and platforms need to collaborate to improve the user experience and drive mainstream adoption.
* There *are* known technical issues during the presented video.

I have tried to summarize every point, making it comprehensive, even if it's a bit longer than a shorter, more selective summary could be.
