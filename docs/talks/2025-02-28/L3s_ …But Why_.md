## Summary of "L3s? …But Why? | Colton Dillion - DEGEN"

### 1. Main Points
- **Introduction and Context**
  - The video discusses the reasons behind the creation and use of Layer 3 (L3) blockchains, particularly focusing on the DEGEN project.
  - It highlights the importance of high throughput and decentralized applications in the context of memes, media, and markets.

- **High Throughput and Decentralization**
  - L3s are necessary for high throughput, which is crucial for rewarding creators and users in decentralized applications.
  - The trade-off between decentralization, data availability, and transaction costs is explained, emphasizing the need for a balance.

- **Customization and Community**
  - L3s allow for more customization and community-specific features, enabling tailored solutions for specific audiences.
  - The community aspect is crucial, as it fosters a sense of identity and shared vision.

- **Ecosystem and Grants**
  - DEGEN offers bounties and grants for builders within its ecosystem, aiming to create brand value and exclusive partnerships.
  - Marketing efforts are directed towards users and builders to foster a peer-to-peer network.

### 2. Key Insights
