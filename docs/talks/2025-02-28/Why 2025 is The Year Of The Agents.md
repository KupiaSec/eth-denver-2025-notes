Here's a summary of Illia Polosukhin's presentation "Why 2025 is The Year Of The Agents", organized as requested:

**1. Main Points:**

*   **AI Agents as the Future of Interaction:** Polosukhin argues that AI agents will become the primary way users interact with the internet and computing, replacing traditional websites and apps.
*   **User-Owned AI:** He advocates for a shift from centralized, profit-driven AI to user-owned AI, where agents are aligned with individual user well-being and economic success.  This is a key differentiator.
*   **Confidentiality and Verifiability:** AI agents need to be both confidential (protecting user data) and verifiable (not subject to arbitrary changes or censorship).
*   **Interoperability and Standardization:**  A crucial element is a standard protocol for agents to interact, exchange data, and make payments (both crypto and fiat).
*   **Blockchain's Role:** Blockchain is presented not as the *focus* of the user experience, but as the foundational, trustless infrastructure for asset tracking, value transfer, and facilitating agent interactions. Chain abstraction is key.
*  **Open Agent Alliance:** Announces the Open Agent Alliance. Near is colaborating with partners to achieve the vision presented.

**2. Key Insights:**

*   **Paradigm Shift from Aggregator to Agent Internet:** The current internet model, dominated by aggregators (Google, Amazon, etc.) that monetize attention, is being replaced.  Instead of users going to siloed apps through aggregators, AI agents will interact directly with specialized agents to achieve user goals.
*   **Agents Eliminate Intermediaries:** AI agents can eliminate layers of software, companies, and decision-makers, leading to greater efficiency and user control. No more "middlemen."
*   **Transformer Architecture Legacy:** Polosukhin ties his prediction to his background, highlighting his work on the Transformer architecture, which underpins much of modern AI. This lends credibility to his vision.
*   **Unsustainable Open Source AI Model:**  He points out the unsustainability of the current open-source AI model, where companies burn cash to train models but lack a direct way to be compensated when their work is open-sourced. User-owned AI is proposed as a solution.
*   **Blockchain as the Back-End:**  Blockchain is *necessary* for user-owned AI to function, providing a trustless, verifiable, and universally accessible ledger.  However, it should be *invisible* to the user, thanks to chain abstraction. User experience is paramount.
*   **"Flywheel" Effect:** As more agents are built, they become more useful, attracting more users. This expanded user base, in turn, incentivizes the creation of even more specialized agents, creating a positive feedback loop.
*   **Example use cases:** AI assistants working in the background to achieve user specified goals. I.e. Booking flights, rebalancing stable coins, buying products.

**3. Practical Takeaways:**

*   **Explore Agent Frameworks:** Developers should start familiarizing themselves with agent frameworks and begin building specialized agents.
*   **Focus on User-Centric Design:**  If building AI-related tools, prioritize user control, data privacy, and verifiability. The user *owns* the AI.
*   **Embrace Interoperability:**  Design agents with the expectation that they will need to communicate and transact with other agents in a standardized way.
*    **Consider the role of the blockchain:** The blockchain is a fundimental tool for asset tracking, value transfer, and facilitating agent interactions.

**4. Additional Notes:**

*   The presentation is highly conceptual but includes a concrete example of an agent interaction (buying headphones).
*   Polosukhin emphasizes that this is a collaborative effort, and the Open Agent Alliance is intended to bring together various players in the ecosystem.
*   The timing of "2025" is likely more aspirational than a hard prediction, but it underscores the sense of urgency and the rapid pace of development in the AI space.
* The use of the word "agent", emphasizes the *action* element. The agents do things for the users.
