# Troll, but Verify: Security Lessons From North Korean Job Candidates

This YouTube video, "Troll, but Verify: Security Lessons From North Korean Job Candidates | Thiago Silva & Michael Be |," details a series of interviews conducted with individuals allegedly applying for jobs at Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange. The interviewers, Thiago Silva and Michael Be, employ a "troll but verify" methodology, deliberately probing for security vulnerabilities by posing potentially unusual or seemingly fabricated questions.

## 1. Main Points

* **North Korean Job Applicants:** The focus is on unusual and potentially suspicious behavior and tactics used by North Korean job candidates to gain employment or information.
* **Trolling with a Purpose:** The interviewers strategically troll applicants with unusual probing questions/scenarios, playing on potential vulnerabilities that might be taken advantage of.
* **Security Lessons:** The key takeaway is to learn security lessons through observing *how* potential North Korean candidates apply for jobs, and what security weaknesses might exist.
* **Faked Resumes/Applications:** The video highlights instances where the candidates seemingly submitted fabricated resumes or employed unusual techniques in their applications.
* **Unusual and Suspicious Tactics:** The interviewers detail instances of candidates using unusual tactics such as requesting large percentages of salary improvements, or application submissions utilizing unusual methods or information. 
* **Information Leaks/Social Engineering:** Examples of potential information leaks or social engineering attempts by the applicants have been highlighted.
* **Compromised Credentials/Multiple Accounts:** The video points towards instances where individuals might be using multiple accounts for application purposes, or obtaining compromised account information.

## 2. Key Insights

* **Sophisticated Social Engineering:** The interviews revealed a level of social engineering sophistication often seen in targeted attacks, not just random attempts. North Korean applicants appear to have specific strategies.
* **Persistence and Determination:**  The applicants demonstrated a high level of persistence in their attempts to gain employment, showing a willingness to explore many options and roles.
* **Limited Knowledge or Misunderstandings:** In some instances, the candidates showed limited knowledge of US geography, holiday events, or cultural norms, which the interviewers used to probe for weaknesses.
* **Unusual Communication Styles:** The dialogue with the candidates, characterized by unusual or unusual phrasing/pauses, hints at techniques to avoid detection by security measures.
* **Use of Automated Tools (Potential):** While not explicitly discussed, the possibility of automated resume generation/application submission tools being used by the candidates was implied.


## 3. Practical Takeaways

* **Enhanced Security Measures:**  This video inspires developing and bolstering security measures to detect and mitigate attempts to gain access or information.
* **Thorough Background Checks**: Companies should conduct thorough background checks, particularly for sensitive roles.
* **Verification of Information:** Critical information must be verified with multiple sources for accuracy.
* **Scrutinize Resumes and Applications**: Pay extra attention to unusual or fabricated information on resumes.
* **Security Training**: Implement robust security training programs to identify and report suspicious behavior.
* **Unusual Questions/Scenarios**: Development of unusual and challenging questions/scenarios during interviews can reveal hidden weaknesses.
* **Red Flags**: Recognize and take action for red flags such as persistent questioning or unusual information sharing.


## 4. Additional Notes

The video is a showcase of security analysis methodologies and is not intended as a definitive guide on North Korean culture or intentions. The accuracy and completeness of the recordings are not independently verified. The video's usefulness focuses on lessons learned from an unusual data-gathering perspective, and does not represent an attack directly against a known threat actor like a Nation-State.
