## Main Points

- **Knowledge Graphs and Web 3**: The speaker discusses the importance of knowledge graphs in the context of Web 3, emphasizing the need for a decentralized, open, and composable knowledge infrastructure.
- **GRC 20 Standard**: A new standard called GRC 20 is introduced, which aims to create a flexible and interoperable way of describing and linking information.
- **Entities and Relations**: The concept of entities and relations is explained, where entities can have multiple types and relations can have properties, forming a global graph of interconnected information.
- **Applications of Knowledge Graphs**: Potential applications include crypto news, decentralized applications, and community-driven fact-checking.
- **Decentralized Knowledge**: The speaker envisions a future where knowledge is decentralized, verifiable, and open, allowing for the creation of custom applications on top of a global knowledge graph.

## Key Insights

- **Data to Knowledge Transformation**: The speaker explains the process of transforming raw data into knowledge through the use of structured information and connections between entities.
- **Interoperability and Flexibility**: The GRC 20 standard is designed to be flexible and interoperable, allowing for the creation of higher-level types and custom applications.
- **Decentralized Verification**: The decentralized nature of the knowledge graph ensures that information is verifiable and can be organized in a blockchain-based record.
- **Community Involvement**: The speaker highlights the role of community involvement in creating and verifying shared facts, leading to a global "high mind" of interconnected knowledge.
- **Future of Web 3**: The speaker believes that when all the right pieces are put together, everything will be rebuilt on top of this foundation, leading to a new era of decentralized applications and knowledge.

## Practical Takeaways

1. **Adopt GRC 20 Standard**: Developers and organizations should consider adopting the GRC 20 standard for creating flexible and interoperable knowledge graphs.
2. **Build on Knowledge Graphs**: Start building applications on top of knowledge graphs to leverage the power of interconnected information.
3. **Contribute to Knowledge**: Contribute to decentralized knowledge graphs by verifying and organizing shared facts, enhancing the collective understanding.
4. **Explore Use Cases**: Explore various use cases of knowledge graphs, such as crypto news, decentralized protocols, and company-specific applications.
5. **Engage Community**: Engage the community in the process of creating and verifying knowledge to build a robust and reliable knowledge graph.

## Additional Notes

- The speaker emphasizes the importance of breaking free from data silos and creating a global graph of interconnected information.
- The concept of knowledge graphs is compared to how the human brain works, where connections between pieces of information lead to a higher level of understanding.
- The speaker believes that the future of Web 3 will be built on top of a solid foundation of decentralized, verifiable, and open knowledge.
