# What Is a Partnership and Why Isn't My DAO One? | Rebecca Matsumura - Fenwick & West

This YouTube video discusses the legal differences between a partnership and a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).  Rebecca Matsumura, an associate attorney at Fenwick & West, clarifies the legal implications of DAOs.

## 1. Main Points

* **Partnerships have established legal frameworks.** They are governed by state laws, which outline specific responsibilities and liabilities of partners.
* **DAOs lack a clear legal framework.**  There's no universally recognized legal status for DAOs.  This lack of clarity creates significant legal risks.
* **Liability is a key differentiator.**  In a partnership, each partner is potentially liable for the full extent of the partnership's debts, even beyond their initial investment.
* **DAOs don't have the same legal structure as traditional businesses.**  They operate on blockchain principles, making the assignment and enforcement of liability complex.
* **DAOs can be used for both for-profit and non-profit ventures.**  This ambiguity compounds the lack of a defined legal framework.
* **There is risk regarding regulatory compliance.**  State and federal regulations applied to traditional businesses might not fully align with DAO operations.  
* **Legal issues of DAOs are evolving and not fully determined.** Courts are beginning to grapple with the legal ramifications of DAOs.


## 2. Key Insights

* **Regulatory uncertainty:** One key insight is the lack of a codified legal framework for DAOs. This poses significant challenges for crypto businesses, as it's not clear how they will be treated under state and federal laws, unlike traditional partnerships.
* **Varying liabilities:**  Significant differences in liability exist. In a partnership, individual partners have unlimited liability; their personal assets may be at risk.   DAOs, with their decentralized structure, are grappling with these issues, as the extent of liability for individual participants (token holders) is still under consideration.
* **DAO as an analog, not a substitute for traditional structures:** DAOs are not a simple replacement for traditional corporate structures.  They operate on blockchain principles and use technology differently. Thus, merely establishing a DAO doesn't erase the need for traditional corporate considerations.
* **Evolving legal case law:** Courts are increasingly weighing in on DAO-related legal issues.  Recent cases, such as *Lio da*, influenced interpretations of the proper classification of DAO operations under state law.
* **The role of insurance:** The video highlights the importance for crypto companies that may be incorporated as DAOs to consider insurance options aimed at covering potential liabilities that arise from actions within or related to the DAO's governance.  

## 3. Practical Takeaways

* **Seek legal counsel:**  Crypto-businesses operating or considering DAOs should consult with qualified legal professionals who understand the complexities of crypto regulations, to assess legal risks and best practices.
* **Develop clear legal documentation:** Define parameters for the DAO, including member responsibilities, to reduce conflicts and uncertainties about liability, and provide transparency in governance process.
* **Consider business structures compliant with existing legal frameworks:**  Explore other established structures like LLCs or corporations that provide a clearer framework to meet the requirements of state and federal laws.  
* **Understand and manage the complexities of liability:**  Carefully evaluate and document risks associated with liability within the DAO.  This may include insurance or other risk mitigation strategies.


## 4. Additional Notes

The video emphasizes the evolving nature of DAO law.  The lack of standardized legal interpretation for DAOs and the diverse, often conflicting, viewpoints concerning their treatment under existing frameworks necessitates ongoing engagement with legal experts and close attention to court rulings.
