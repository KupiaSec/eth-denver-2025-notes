# Securing ZK Applications | Tim Becker - ChainLight

This summary focuses on the key points of Tim Becker's ChainLight presentation on securing ZK applications.


## 1. Main Points

* **Overview of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):**  A high-level explanation of ZKPs, emphasizing the roles of Prover and Verifier.
* **ZKPs in Blockchain Applications:**  ZKPs are introduced as a method for proving statements without revealing sensitive data.
* **Two Key Properties of ZKPs:**  Foundationally, ZK proofs need completeness and soundness.
* **Potential Threats to ZKP Systems:** The presented speaker discusses potential types of attacks and ways they can impact the security of ZKP applications.
* **Importance of Comprehensive Security Testing:** Emphasizing the need for thorough testing.
* **Identifying Vulnerabilities:**  The importance of identifying and understanding how vulnerabilities in the application can compromise it.
* **Circuit Libraries and ZK VMs:** Modern ZK application development relies on standardized components and libraries.  The speaker touches upon vulnerabilities in these.
* **Interactive and Non-interactive Protocols:** Different types of ZKPs are discussed in terms of their interaction model.
* **Real-world Examples and Applications:** The speaker describes ZKPs in use cases such as cryptocurrencies (e.g. Tornado Cash).
* **Trade-offs in Design:** Balancing complexity with efficiency in the ZK proof systems is presented as a critical design aspect.


## 2. Key Insights

* **Completeness vs. Soundness:** Completeness ensures that if a statement is true, the proof will be valid. Soundness ensures that if a proof is valid, the statement must be true.  These properties are crucial for ensuring the integrity of ZKPs' output.  The video points out that subtle errors in these could allow attackers to forge valid proofs.
* **Threat Models in ZK Applications:** The speaker discusses various potential threat models. Input leakage, malicious input, and compromised parties/actors are all risks that must be considered. Understanding the different types of potential attacks helps prioritize and build robust measures for defense.
* **ZK Circuit Libraries:**  Standard circuit libraries are frequently used for ZK applications, but their use introduces new potential vulnerabilities that need to be considered during development.
* **Multi-Prover Systems:** The advantages of utilizing multiple provers in a system, such as reducing centralization risk, were highlighted.


## 3. Practical Takeaways

* **Thorough Security Analysis:**  Develop complete and thorough security analysis of both the application's front-end and back-end components, accounting for all possible attack surfaces.
* **Formal Verification:** Leverage formal verification techniques to increase confidence in the correctness of ZK proofs and associated systems.
* **Independent Auditing:** Engage security experts to perform independent security audits to identify vulnerabilities that may have been missed during internal reviews.
* **Regular Updates:** The security landscape is dynamic; stay updated on the latest developments, vulnerabilities, and best practices for ZK proof systems and adapt your implementation accordingly.


## 4. Additional Notes

The presentation was quite technical and detailed, going beyond a simple overview. It highlighted the importance of rigorous security considerations for ZK applications, extending beyond just the proof itself to the entire ZK system including dependencies (Libraries, VMs).  The emphasis is on a layered approach to security, addressing both the front-end and back-end of the application. The speaker also brought attention to self-exploiting and implementation vulnerabilities.
