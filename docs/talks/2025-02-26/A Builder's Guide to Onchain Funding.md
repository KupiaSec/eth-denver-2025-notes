   - Beefy: A yield optimizer that shares revenue with builders who contribute to the protocol.

5. **How Protocols Can Use Divvi**
   - Protocols can define impact reward functions and pledge capital to builders who help grow the protocol.
   - Builders can register referrals on-chain and receive rewards for bringing users to the protocol.

6. **Benefits for Builders**

   - They can focus on building value without worrying about funding.
